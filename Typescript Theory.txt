Typescript is considered to be a superscript of javascript
This statement can be true but it does not add more new features than javascript

Typescript when compiled, it actually converts itself to javascript and then is able to show the results, 
so it does not make any new features available to us that js doesn't have

It just allows you to write js in much precise manner so that your code do not come accross any error at runtime
Like you can write js code but if any error, it might run or compile.

*TYPESCRIPT, is honestly, a Development Tool*

Eg. Consider in js we have often seen operations like this: 
2 + '2' = 22
true + 1 = 2
undefined + 2 = NaN
nul + 2 = 2

In js, these all things get compiled and we get those results, but is it true, is it logical to add a string with a number or 
adding boolean value with number value to get some result.

To cope up this or to handle this before compile time, Typescript comes handy
Typescript is a *TYPE SAFETY* composition where you are not allowed to do such operations, meaning you just can't add any null value with number value here,
it will show an error and will not compile till you solve it.

Simply saying, Typescript provides *STATIC CHECKING*. 
Considering above operations, typescript will just tell you that this should not happen or you cannot do this while writing the code itself,
Isn't this good thing, you can handle and modify your errors while writing the code itself, no need to wait for compiling and then checking what error actually is

In typescript, you write more code than what you write in js, but it is worth it

Development process:
1. You write your code in ts or tsx (while writing react)
2. This code is transpiled (converted) in js while compilation.

To run a ts file, you just need to type *tsc filename.ts*
This compiles and converts ts file in js

Basic Syntax to define a variable
let variable_name: type = value
type is data types which you need to specify, not necessarily

Data Types in Typescript:

1. **number**  

In typescript, there is nothing like int or float to be defined seperately, everything comes under 'number'

Syntax to define: 
let num1: number = 22
let num2: number = 33

2. **string**

Syntax to define:
let greetings: string = "Hello"

3. **boolean**  

let isLoggedIn: boolean = false

4. **any**  

When any variable is not assigned a type, the bydefault type it takes is any
Using any tells that please remove type checking as my variable will hold any value like string number or anything

5. **void**  

Void represents the absence of any value. It’s typically used as the return type of functions that don’t return anything.

6. **null**  
7. **undefined**  
8. **never** 

to be used when function NEVER returns anything, so you can use it while throwing any error as it will handle the function and throw any error 
Never represents value which is never observed, in return type, this means that function throws an exception or error or terminates the program

9. **object**  
10. **array**  
11. **tuple**  
12. **enum**  
13. **unknown**  
14. **bigint**  
15. **symbol**


Type inference:

What happens is when we write 
let variable_name: number = 222, we are giving an obvious value 222 with assigning the type as number which is certainly not a good practice
Not saying that you should not give type but cases where you are immediatlely assigning the same value which type you have defined, 
it's not a good practive
WHY?
because typescript is smart enough to know that this type is string
lets say you types let num1 = 11, now typescript automatically gets to know that this is type: number, 
so in such cases, no need to give a type when you are giving the value immediately

Type inference is important in a case which is type: any
suppose you created a variable which you don't know what value will it hold, either string, number or boolean
what you do is without mentioning a type, you just declare the variable and in this case, the variable is assigned as type: any
Using any tells that please remove type checking as my variable will hold any value like string number or anything
What makes it challenging is, when you have given string value to this variable and suppose any other coder uses this variable and gives a boolean value
Both are logically doing correct job at their side but if that variable gets a string value, so you won't want anyone to make it boolean or number 

In such cases Type inference is important as you mention the type for the variable so that no one can change or modify the value with other types
Another important use case of type inference is whole functions

Functions: 

Syntax: 

function function_name (value1: type, value2: type...){
    return ___
}

Syntax is almost same as javascript
There are some things to look for, firstly argumenets passed in function should have a type specified (type inference to be used)
Why? Because when calling the function and passing values, if bydefault type 'any' is kept, there can be an issue or mismatch
Suppose you want the value as a string, but another user passes integer value, Breaks the logic right
So here we need type inference as to specify that argumenet to be of a particular type

You can also make type safety by declaring a function with return type

function function_name (value1: type, value2: type...): number{
    return ___
}

How this helps, consider a example where you are passing numbers as argument and returning boolean or string value, 
These functions do exist and have a meaning too like returning true or false as boolean or string for the passed number to be prime.
But what about the cases where you pass a number and expect number to return and instead a string or boolean is returned, this makes the code messy and error handling becomes to much hectir
To solve this problem, we use type safety so to make function return what we want and not random datatype. 

Functions like map where you compute and return values from array or objects
You can use type inference and not using it also is okay for the map function to return the datatype. 


Void datatype for a function: to be used when your function is not returning anything
Normally not declaring datatype as void also works but it's a bad practice, so make it void use type inferencing even if function not returning anything
This practice makes the function strict to not return anything.

function greetingUser(username: string): void {
    console.log(`Good morning`, username);
}
console.log(greetingUser("Vinayak"));
